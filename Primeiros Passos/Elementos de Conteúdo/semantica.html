    <h1>Sobre mim</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>What is Lorem Ipsum?</strong> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of
      the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
      standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
      galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
      survived not only five centuries,
      <em>but also the leap into electronic</em> but also the leap into
      electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
      popularised in the 1960s with the release of
      <mark>Letraset sheets containing</mark>Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
      recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
      <s>including versions of Lorem Ipsum</s>including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

      Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be
      distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
      The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
      distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
      making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
      web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
      search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
      infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
      accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

      The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below
      for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus
      Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original
      form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
      Rackham.
